Revision history for CHI

** denotes an incompatible change

0.102  Mar 6, 2009

- Skip get_namespaces in tests with drivers that don't support it
- Eliminate unconditional use of Data::Serializer in tests; improve error when Data::Serializer not installed

0.101  Mar 2, 2009

- Don't use Data::Serializer up front

0.10  Feb 28, 2009

- Switch to Mouse instead of Moose, to reduce install dependencies and overhead. Eliminate
  Moose-isms as needed. Eventually may switch to Any::Moose but want to get comfortable
  with Mouse first.
- Eliminate dependencies on Data::Serializer, File::Slurp, and Module::Find
- Revert Memory driver implementation to more readable and illustrative form
- Handle value-too-large errors in FastMmap driver
- Change expire_if option to simply return undef, without actually expiring the item
- Deprecate expire_if method - this can easily be done manually, and it now differs
  deceptively from the expire_if option to get()
- When serializer passed as a string, use raw=>1 so as not to hex-encode or insert token
- Allow serializer to be passed as a hashref
- Fix bug when specifying serializer with multilevel driver

0.091 Jan 2, 2009

- Ensure that unlink_on_exit=0 is being passed to FastMmap
- Allow serializer to be passed as a simple string
- Documentation fixes

0.09  Dec 30, 2008

- Added Null driver
- Fixed main docs regarding Memcached driver
- Changed FastMmap driver to pass all unrecognized options onto Cache::FastMmap, to better

- Added expires time to set logs
- Added get_multi_array alongside get_multi_arrayref
- Added test for get_namespaces

0.081  Sep 24, 2008

0.08  Sep 23, 2008

- ** Move CHI::Driver::Memcached to its own distribution
- Many internal changes to make greater use of Moose (Dave Rolsky).
- Add serializer option, allowing control over how data is serialized/deserialized
- The FastMmap driver was not actually making use of the init_file,
  cache_size, page_size, or num_pages options. Reported by Mike
  Astle. RT #35819. (Dave Rolsky)
- The clear method did not work with the Memcached driver. RT #32859.
- Allow suppression of renames in CHI::Driver::File by overriding
  generate_temporary_filename

0.07  Mar 12, 2008

- Add Date::Parse to build dependencies

0.06  Feb 29, 2008

- Created separate manual for developing drivers (CHI::Driver::Development)

- ** Eliminated automatic namespace selection based on caller; namespace now defaults to
